# Code Validation

<div class='subtitle'>
Secure the code that your agent generates and executes.

Code validation is a critical component of any code-generating LLM system, as it helps to ensure that the code generated by the LLM is safe and secure. Guardrails provides a simple way to validate the code generated by your LLM, using a set of pre-defined rules and checks.

> **Code Validation Risks**<br/>
> Code validation is a critical component of any code-generating LLM system. For example, an insecure agent could:

> * Generate code that contains **security vulnerabilities**, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting

> * Generate code that **contains bugs or errors**, causing the system to crash or behave unexpectedly

> * Produce code that escapes a **sandboxed execution environment**

> * Generate code that is **not well-formed or does not follow best practices**, causing the system to be difficult to maintain or understand
