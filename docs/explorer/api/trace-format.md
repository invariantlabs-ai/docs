# Trace Format

The Explorer supports agent traces made up of sequences of events like messages, tool calls and environment outputs. The required format is compatible with the [OpenAI chat data structure](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) with [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) support.

For more information on the format, see the [Guardrails Basics](../../guardrails/basics.md).
